# Green House Gas Emission Visualization

1. Gathered 25 years' global green house gas emission data.
2. Implemented folium to visualize green house gas emission
3. Interactive map with slider is used to display green house gas emission changing pattern over past 25 years.

# Note:
Github doesn't support interactive map. But you can do this in your local jupyter notebook.
Good luck!
